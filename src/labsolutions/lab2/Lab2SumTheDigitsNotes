*Code Walkthrough:*
	
	Main Method and Test Cases:
		The main method is where the program execution begins. 
		
		Three test cases are defined using the integers 12345, 9876, and 1001 to 
		demonstrate how the sumDigits method works.
		
		The results of the sumDigits method are printed to the console for each test case, 
		showing the sum of the digits of each number.

	Static Method sumDigits:
		The sumDigits method is defined as static because it operates on the input number directly 
		and doesn't require an instance of the class.
	
	Parameters and Return Value:
		It takes a single integer number as its parameter.
		It returns the sum of the digits of the input number.

	Calculating the Sum of Digits:
		Initialization: The variable sum is initialized to 0. This will hold the cumulative sum of the digits.
	
		Looping through the Digits:
			A while loop is used to process each digit of the number. 
			The loop continues until number becomes 0.
	
				Inside the loop:
					The expression number % 10 extracts the last digit of the number 
					(e.g., for 123, this would give 3).
					This digit is added to the sum.
					The number is then divided by 10 (number /= 10), 
					effectively removing the last digit (e.g., 123 becomes 12).
					
		Return: Once the loop has processed all digits, the method returns the final value of sum.
	
	Testing the Method:
		The main method tests the sumDigits method by calling it with different integers and printing the results.
		This allows verification that the method correctly sums the digits for various inputs.
		

*Learning Takeaways:*

	Static Methods:
		The program introduces the concept of static methods in Java, which can be called without 
		creating an instance of the class. This is useful for utility functions like sumDigits that 
		operate independently of object state.
	
	Looping and Modulus Operator:
		The use of the while loop and the modulus operator (%) to extract digits from a number 
		demonstrates important programming techniques for working with numbers at the digit level.
	
	Integer Division:
		The method utilizes integer division (/) to remove the last digit of a number, 
		which is a fundamental operation in many algorithms involving numbers.
	
	Method Testing:
		The program emphasizes the importance of testing methods with various inputs to 
		ensure they work as expected. This is a key practice in software development.
	
	Breaking Down Problems:
		This exercise shows how to break down a problem (summing the digits of a number) 
		into smaller, manageable steps, such as extracting each digit, summing them, and 
		handling the overall logic in a loop.
