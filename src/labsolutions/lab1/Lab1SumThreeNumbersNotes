*Code Walkthrough:*

	Importing Scanner:
		The program imports java.util.Scanner, a utility class used for reading input from the user via the console.
	
	Creating a Scanner Object:
		A Scanner object is instantiated using Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);, allowing the program to 
		capture user input.
	
	Prompting the User for Input:
		The program prompts the user to enter three integers, one at a time.
		Each prompt is done using System.out.print, which keeps the cursor on the same line as the prompt.
		The integers are read and stored in variables firstNumber, secondNumber, and thirdNumber using scanner.nextInt().
	
	Calculating the Sum:
		The sum of the three integers is calculated by adding the three variables: firstNumber + secondNumber + thirdNumber.
		The result is stored in the variable sum.
	
	Outputting the Result:
		The program prints the sum in a complete sentence, combining the individual integers and their sum in a readable 
		format using System.out.println.
	
	Closing the Scanner:
		Finally, the Scanner object is closed using scanner.close() to release the resource, which is good programming practice.


*Learning Takeaways:*

	Basic Input Handling:
		This program introduces basic input handling in Java, showing how to capture and process user input using the 
		Scanner class.
	
	Working with Integers:
		You learn how to work with integers in Java, including reading integer inputs and performing arithmetic operations 
		like addition.
	
	String Concatenation:
		The program demonstrates string concatenation to create a meaningful output that combines text with the computed 
		sum of the integers.
	
	User Interaction:
		The program showcases how to interact with users through prompts and how to display results in a user-friendly way.
	
	Resource Management:
		Reinforces the importance of closing the Scanner object after use, which is essential for good resource management 
		in Java applications.
	
	Arithmetic Operations:
		Provides practice in performing arithmetic operations on variables and using the result in subsequent steps of the program.
