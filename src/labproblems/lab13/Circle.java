 * Write two methods in the Circle class called fitsInside, each
 * with different parameters (one with a Circle and one with a
 * Rectangle as a parameter). Return true if this Circle fits inside
 * the other shape (think about some metric of one shape that can
 * be compared against the other). Test this in ShapeTester by
 * seeing if your Circle fits in another Circle, a Rectangle, and a Square

 * Test this class by adding a circle to the list of shapes in the ShapeTester main method.
